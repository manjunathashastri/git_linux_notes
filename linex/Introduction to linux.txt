What is a server?
high configuration computer

Mobile: RAM   Storage(HDD)    Processor(CPU)  + android OS 
Laptop: RAM   Storage(HDD)    Processor(CPU)  + windows OS
Servers: RAM   Storage(HDD)    Processor(CPU)  + Linux OS ==> linux server

Hardware components?
--------------------
1.RAM   2.Storage(HDD)  3.Processor(CPU) 


if we can connect these H/W parts, Operating system(OS)

What is OS?
-----------
it takes input from user, it will connect to H/W compoents & completes you are requests


windows servers ?   7-10% 
Linux  ? 90%


Linux:
------
was found in 1970's ==> unix

What is Opensource?
-------------------
secret  ==> Compositions & how do they make
windows ==> to develop windows OS there are lot of programms/code will be written, which will be kept secretly
unix   ==> to develop linux OS there are lot of programms/code will be written, which is avaialble in internet for free 
linus tolwards ==> he took unix source code, developed his own version ==> linux


Windows:                        Linux:
--------                        ------
Paid OS                         Free OS
is not opensource               its opensource
Single user based OS            multi user based OS 
Less secure                     More secure

GUI                             CLI 



Android is linux based OS 
ios is linux based OS


To start with Linux?
--------------------
1. Format my PC . install LINUX os
2. using extra softwares install LInux
3. We can get linux servers for free directly from Cloud service providers ( AWS ) 
   Virtual servers ==>  we can rent for free from AWS
   RAM:1GB HDD:8GB CPU: 1core 
  
Create an acoount in AWS ?
--------------------------
signup https://aws.amazon.com/
email id , phone number , Debit card / credit card ( dont use rupay cards), card is enabled international transactions 


we will launch an server in AWS & we will connect to that?
----------------------------------------------------------
Servers will be available in aws by name ec2 

in order to acccess servers we have use an s/w ==> gitbash ( https://git-scm.com/download/win )

Agenda:
=======
- word count (wc) 
- egrep , rgrep

Note:
-----
Directories
1. to copy 1 directory to another directory
   syntax: cp -r <source_directory> <target_directory>

   Here: -r ==> recursiveness (consider all files,subdirectories inside that dierctory)

2. MV (move) command can be used in two ways
   - for Files ==> we can use to rename a file
   - for Directories ==> apart from renaming, mv(move) is also used to move a directory to another directory (i.e cut & paste directories)

3. in linux * this indicates all 




word count:
-----------
word count is used to count number of lines, number of words & number of charecters in a file
  syntax: wc <fileName>

other options with word counts
   i.  to count only number of lines 
       syntax: wc -l <fileName>
       
   ii. to count only number of words
       syntax: wc -w <fileName>
       
   iii. to count only number of charecters
        syntax: wc -c <fileName>


Grep command:
-------------
to search a pattern (keyword) in a file
if a pattern(keyword) is found it will print all the matched line

syntax: grep <pattern_tobe_searched> <filename>

        grep hyderbad census_data 

        to search for a pattren without case sensisnsivity
       

Other use cases of grep command: 
--------------------------------

- To search ignoring case sensitivities:
  grep -i <pattern_to_search> fileName
  i ==> search by ignoring case sensitivity 
  
- egrep:
  -----
  its used to search multiple patterns in same file
  
  grep -e "<pattern_1>" -e "<pattern_2>" fileName

- rgrep (RECURSIVE grep):
  -----------------------
  Search pattern in present working directory & also in all sub-directories.
  
  grep -r <pattern_to_search> <directory_name>
  
   - rgrep will list filename containing pattern & also prints the entire line which contains charecter.
   - To search patterns in all files of present working directory:
      syntax: grep -r <pattern_to_search> *

What is a link file and how many types?
---------------------------------------
Link file is a short cut file to the original file.
 
There are two types of links files available in Linux.
(i) Soft link
(ii) Hard link

What is soft link and how to create it?
---------------------------------------
- Soft link is nothing but a short cut file. 

Syntax: ln -s <original_file_or_directoryname> <linkfilename_or_directorywithpath> 

- If original file is deleted, no use of softlink  (ie., we cannot access the original data by selecting the link file)
- Soft link can be applied on both directories and files.
- inode number of original and soft link files are different.
- If we edit original file, the softlink are also updated automatically.


What is hard link and how to create it?
--------------------------------------
- Hard link in nothing but a backup of a file. 

Syntax: ln <original_file_name> <linkfilename> 

- If the original file is deleted, there is no effect on hard link file. (i.e., we can access the original file data even though the link file is deleted.)
- Hard links can only be applied on files only not on directories. 
- inode number of original and hard link files are same.

Note on hardlinks:
- If the original is edited, the updations are applied on both original and hard link files.
- The size of the hard link file is same as the size of the original file.


Note:
----
  what is inode number?
  Linux creates a unique number for all files & directories that gets created, 
  to check i node number, ls -li <file/directory name>, first column shows inode number

File system in linux:
-------------------------------


In Windows: all OS files will be stored in C drive

In Linux: all OS files will be stored in /  

[ / is called as ROOT directory ]

/ ==> ROOT directory , is like c drive in windows & it will contain all linux os related files & folders.


to go to ROOT directory ==> cd /



Folders in root directory:

[ec2-user@ip-172-31-16-223 ~]$ pwd
/home/ec2-user
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-16-223 ~]$ cd /
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-16-223 /]$ pwd
/
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-16-223 /]$ ls
bin   dev  home  lib64  media  opt   root  sbin  sys  usr
boot  etc  lib   local  mnt    proc  run   srv   tmp  var
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-16-223 /]$


Important Folders in root directory:

1) bin: 
   ---
    It contains the commands and binary files. 
       User can access the commands. 
       Ex:  mkdir, ls, cd, psâ€¦.

2) etc: 
   ---
    It contains the configuration files.
    
3) home: 
   ----
   It contains home directories for all users to store their personal files.
   Ex: /home/ec2-user or /home/bharath

4) var:
   ----
    It contains variable files. 
    This includes system log files(/var/log), emails (/var/mail)
    
5) tmp : 
   -----
    It contains the temporary files.

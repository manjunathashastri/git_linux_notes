What is Piping?  
===============
    | 
   A way of connecting commands together. 
   A way of passing data from the output of one command as the input to another command.

usecase(i): to print only line number 99 from myFile
        
		
          [ec2-user@ip-172-31-16-223 ~]$ tail -2 numbers_file
          Line 99
          Line 100
          [ec2-user@ip-172-31-16-223 ~]$		 
		
		observation: tail -2 numbers_file will print last 2 lines of the file. but we need only first line (i.e line 99) from the printed ouput, here i can join 2 commands using piping | which will take input from previous command & generate new output.
		
	      [ec2-user@ip-172-31-16-223 ~]$ tail -2 numbers_file | head -1
          Line 99
          [ec2-user@ip-172-31-16-223 ~]$
	
		
		
		
	(ii) to see / display 97th line only
		    tail -3 numbers_file | head -1


        (iii) to display 9th line of a file
		     head -10 numbers_file | tail -1




Grep 
----
grep is used to search the pattern (keyword) in a file.
if pattern is found, it will print all matched lines /entire line

syntax: grep <pattern_to_search> fileName

Note: Pattern = name =string all are same

Sleep command:
--------------
it will pause your terminal/shell for certain time

syntax: sleep <time_in_seconds>
        sleep 30


ps
--------
It is used to display information about running processes.
which stands for "process status."

ps -aux:
-------
is used to list all process running in linux.
ps -ux  ==> displays only processes started by current user
ps -aux ==> displays all processes started by all user

When you run `ps aux`, the command will display a list of processes in a tabular format. Here's a breakdown of the columns you might see:

- USER: The username of the owner of the process.
- PID: The unique Process ID that identifies each running process.
- %CPU: The percentage of CPU (processor) usage by the process.
- %MEM: The percentage of RAM (memory) usage by the process.
- START: The start time of the process.
- TIME: The total accumulated CPU time used by the process.
- COMMAND: which commans created the process.

Here's an example output of `ps aux`:

```
USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
john     12345  5.0  2.0 200000 100000 ?       R    Sep10  10:30 /usr/bin/example
mary     23456  0.0  0.5  50000  25000 pts/1   S    Sep11   0:45 /usr/bin/another
root     34567  1.0  1.5 150000  75000 tty1     Ss   Sep09   2:00 /sbin/init


kill
--------
kill command is used to stop/ terminate the running process (ps -ef)
syntax: kill -9 <ProcessID>
        9==> signal
		
		
SED:
----
 sed command is used to replace a string/pattern without opening file.
 
 syntax: 
 
 sed -i 's/<old_name>/<new_name>/g' filename
 
 
   [ec2-user@ip-172-31-16-223 ~]$ cat samplefile2
   Hello all,
   we are learning unix
   [ec2-user@ip-172-31-16-223 ~]$

   to replace name unix with Linux in above example ==> sed -i 's/unix/Linux/g' samplefile2
   
   
   
--------------------------------------


Find:
-----

find command is used to search for a file/folder.

Find provides multiple options for searching a file eg: name, size, group, user, date, permissions, etc..,
Note:- Some times you are trying to find some files you got permission denied errors, On that case use sudo before the
command

syntax: find <path> -name <filename_tobe_searched>

find /home/ec2-user -iname  <filename_tobe_searched>

i ==> ignore case-insensitive


To search only a directory 
find <path> -type d  -name <directoryname_tobe_searched>

To search only a file
find <path> -type f  -name <filename_tobe_searched>

Assignment:
-----------
find command to list files size more than 1GB

SSH (Secure Shell):
-------------------
using ssh we can login to linux server 
SSH is the most commonly used way to login secuerly to any linux servers

In SSH we have two type of logging in:
---------------------------------------
    1. using private key file (.pem file ) ( more secure)
	   
	   so far we have logged in to ec2 by this type (using .pem file or private key file)
	    
		syntax: to login using pem file
		ssh -i <path_to_private_key_file>  <username>@<ipaddress>
		ssh -i "Sept_Key_pair.pem" ec2-user@ec2-54-224-83-60.compute-1.amazonaws.com
		
		Note: .pem file is called as private key file....
	   
    2. using password  ( less secure)
	    
		syntax: to login using password
		ssh <username>@<ipaddress>
        
		ssh yash@54.224.83.60


Note: by default aws / linux blocks password based authentication, so to change that

How to login server from users which we have created using passwords?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. In linux servers by default, password authentication is set no(disabled), 
(login as root) enable in the /etc/ssh/sshd_config  file and restart sshd service
     (PasswordAuthentication no ) change to (PasswordAuthentication yes)

     service sshd restart

2.In password based authentication you need to provide password mandatorily while logging in

Note:
syntax to set password for user 
passwd <usersName>



uptime
-------
is used to check from how long the system is up & running
  (or) 
how long since server is started


who
----
command is used to check how many user logged in to system


Hostname
--------
command is used to print your server name
